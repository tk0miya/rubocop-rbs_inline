        # RBS::Inline requires `@rbs!` comments to be standalone comments,
        # meaning they should not have any code immediately following them.
        # A blank line after the `@rbs!` block ensures proper separation.
        #
        # @example
        #   # bad
        #   # @rbs! type foo = Integer
        #   def method
        #   end
        #
        #   # good
